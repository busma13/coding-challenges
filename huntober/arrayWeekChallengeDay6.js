/* Array Week Challenge - Day 6

This week has only 6 days of challenges, and this is day 6. Ready to mix it up and put those array functions to good use? I hope so!

Today you'll be plugging in your functions to a skeleton react project to create a sliding puzzle game. Remember those things? I've added comments to the project Codepen, but before you click over there let's go over some key tasks and notes.

Here is the Codepen for the project: https://codepen.io/blawblawLaw/pen/xxjMNrN

You'll see 3 files: html, css, and js already over there. Please do the following:

    Fork the Codepen if it didn't automatically
    Add a link to your Github or Twitter to the footer in the html file (I know Codepen outside links don't work, but humor me)
    Insert your daily functions where noted in the js file
        Note that they need specific names and parameters
        Remember to insert any noted code from the comment within the functions
    Play your game! Are there bugs? No worries, debug away

This is my first time having people blind-build functions to plug into a project, so if you get stuck feel free to reach out! It could be that I need to modify the instructions.

I want to point out that I did call it a skeleton project because it is! Feel free to make it your own and add styles or content. Personally, I want to investigate sprites and try that out for the individual tiles so that I can easily use any square image and have a grid size selector.
